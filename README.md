# ToDoListFlask

This is a little To Do List I made in Flask to absorb the features. If you are interested in this project (which you probably aren't), here are instructions to run this locally:

Run ```git clone https://github.com/shdfe/ToDoFlask.git```

Create venv: ```python3 -m venv venv```

Activate: ```venv\Scripts\activate``` on windows, and ```source venv/bin/activate``` on mac.

Now, install with: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Make ```.flaskenv``` file or just run this command:

  On Windows:
    ```set FLASK_APP=todo.py```
    
Now, run the app with this: ```flask run```, and go to ```https://127.0.0.1:5000``` on a browser.

Thank you for visiting!
